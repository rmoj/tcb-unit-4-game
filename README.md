Star Wars: Sith Happens is a web-based JQuery fighting game in which you are able to pick a character to fight with against enemy characters.

## How to Play

At the start you are shown characters you can click on. If you click on one of them, that character becomes your character, and the remainder becomes enemies you have to defeat. You then get to choose an enemy to fight with. If you click on one of the enemies, that character is moved to the defender section. You can now attack by clicking on the Attack button. Everytime you attack, the enemy's health points (HP) is decreased by an amount equal to your attack power. However, each attack is met by a counter-attack by your enemy which decreases your HP by an amount equal to the counter attack power of the enemy.

Your goal is to reduce the enemy's HP to zero or below to defeat him before your own HP drops to zero. In order to win, you have to defeat all enemies.

Note that, your attack power is increased by an amount equivalent to your base attack power, while the enemy's counterattack power remains the same throughout the fight. Also, each character has been assigned different amounts of health points, attack power, and counter attack power.
